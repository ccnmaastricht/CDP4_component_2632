## Title
Visuo-motor integration model performing eye movement and reaching tasks

## Description
Creation of a common NEST network model to control arm and eye movements of a (virtual and real) robot in a closed-loop system able to perform non-trivial goal-directed behaviour. The CDP4 model builds on and extents the visuo-motor eye movement model created in SGA1.
